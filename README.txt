In this project, there are a lot of math problem which is solved or written with python. The reason of I did this project is improving my python skills and 
sharing what i did. You can look up my algorithms and have an idea how you can use operations, functions, loops etc. or you can write your own algorithms. 
Because there is more than one way to solve problems in math.
